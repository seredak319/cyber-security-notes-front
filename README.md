# Frontend with React and Redux: Dockerized with Nginx

## Overview
Welcome to the frontend of our application! As the developer, I've crafted this frontend component using React and Redux. It serves as the user interface for our web application, offering a modern and intuitive experience for our users.

## Technologies Used
- **React:** I've utilized version 18.2.0 to power the core functionality and user interface of our frontend.
- **Redux:** For state management, I've opted for the @reduxjs/toolkit version 2.0.1, ensuring scalability and predictability in our application architecture.
- **React Router:** Version 6.21.3 facilitates seamless navigation and routing within our application.
- **Bootstrap and Reactstrap:** Versions 5.3.2 and 9.2.0 respectively provide a sleek and responsive design framework for our frontend components.
- **Other Dependencies:** Additional libraries such as axios for HTTP requests, react-markdown for Markdown rendering, and qrcode.react for QR code generation, among others, have been incorporated.

## Dockerization with Nginx
To streamline deployment and ensure consistency across environments, our frontend is Dockerized and served using Nginx. This setup allows for easy scaling and deployment in containerized environments.

## Development and Testing
- **Testing Libraries:** I've employed @testing-library/react and @testing-library/jest versions 13.4.0 and 5.17.0 respectively for robust unit and integration testing.
- **Linting and Code Quality:** Our codebase adheres to standard coding practices enforced by the standard version 17.1.0 package, ensuring readability and maintainability.

## Scripts and Build Process
- **Start:** To launch the development server and begin working on the frontend, execute `npm start`.
- **Build:** Generate a production-optimized build of the frontend application by using `npm run build`.
- **Test:** Run `npm test` to execute unit tests and ensure the integrity of the codebase.

## Browser Support
Frontend is designed to be compatible with modern web browsers, including the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
